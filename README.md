The influence of technology on creativity among the younger generation has become a critical topic in the digital era. While technology offers access to innovative tools and global resources, it also raises concerns about diminishing originality and over-reliance on AI-driven solutions. This study aims to assess the dual impact of technology on creativity, with a focus on understanding how factors such as screen time, the use of AI tools, and independent problem-solving preferences shape creative potential.

To achieve this, advanced machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), are utilized. SVM is applied for classifying participants into different creativity levels based on self-reported scores and behavioral patterns. RCNN, known for its ability to process complex data, is employed to predict the creative potential influenced by various technological factors, such as reliance on AI tools for idea generation and preferences for collaborative or independent problem-solving.

Data for this study is collected through targeted surveys capturing demographic details, daily screen time, AI tool usage, and participants' perception of technologyâ€™s impact on their creativity. Initial findings indicate that technology fosters creativity by providing platforms for collaboration, inspiration, and access to diverse tools. However, overuse or dependency on technology can hinder independent thinking and reduce opportunities for original idea generation.

This research highlights the nuanced relationship between technology and creativity in young individuals. While technology can serve as a catalyst for innovation, it must be used judiciously to prevent adverse effects on creative independence. The insights from this study aim to guide educators, policymakers, and developers in designing strategies and tools that balance technological engagement with fostering intrinsic creativity.

By leveraging the predictive power of SVM and RCNN, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of how technology shapes the creative processes of the young generation, offering actionable recommendations for nurturing creativity in a technology-driven world.
